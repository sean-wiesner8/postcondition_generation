# Postcondition Generations
Postcondition generation with GPT-3.5 on programming problems in HumanEval and MBPP datasets. Postconditions differ from test cases as they test for truths relating to arbitrary inputs rather than specific inputs.

Generations can be found in `humanEval_generations.txt` and `mbpp_generations.txt`.
